			<p>I'm a junior student in Electrical Engineering department from University of Washington.I like coding, running, playing the piano and also a super fun of Crinimal Minds.I was born in a small-industrial based city of China and both of my parents are engieers. So I fell in love with electrical world when I got a set of electronic blocks at 7. Though I gradually move to digital world now, I'm still excited when playing with transistors, LEDs and capacitors. I love shushine, which is the only probelm I have with rainy Seattle even though I love the this city.</p>
